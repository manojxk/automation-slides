**Slide 7: Before and After Automation**

| Process                  | Before Automation                                              | After Automation                                            | Time Saving |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Jenkins Build Trigger** | Manual process involving searching component name, accessing Bitbucket, and triggering Jenkins build, followed by manual monitoring and notification. | Fully automated process: Simply provide microservice and environment names to trigger Jenkins build; receive automated build result notifications. | Significant time saved in triggering builds and monitoring. |
| **Jenkins Build Reports** | Manually retrieve Jenkins build reports by accessing Jenkins dashboard. | Automated retrieval of the latest Jenkins build reports through API calls, reducing the effort and time required. | Substantial time saved in accessing and reviewing reports. |
| **Bitbucket Merge Checks** | Manually check forward and backward merges on Bitbucket branches. | Automated scripts perform checks and raise pull requests if necessary, ensuring code integrity. | Considerable time saved in code merge validation. |
| **RLM ID Creation**       | All RLM IDs created manually, a time-consuming and error-prone process. | Automated generation of RLM IDs during release, eliminating manual efforts and reducing errors. | Significant time saved in RLM ID creation. |
| **RLM Reports**           | Manually search for component names in RLM and enter RLM IDs in an Excel sheet. | Automated script retrieves and populates data in an Excel file from RLM, eliminating manual data entry. | Substantial time saved in generating RLM reports. |
| **Validation and Verification** | Manual validation processes with longer verification times. | Innovative automated methods for validation, significantly reducing verification time. | Substantial time saved in validation and verification. |

- Text: "Our Vision"
- Bullet Points:
  - **Seamless automation:** We envisioned a future where release activities were fully automated, from triggering Jenkins builds to RLM ID creation.
  - **Enhanced productivity:** Automation would unlock new levels of productivity, reducing release times, operational costs, and human errors.
  - **Cost-effectiveness:** By automating resource allocation and optimization, we aimed to achieve significant cost savings while maintaining and even improving product quality.

**Slide 5: Project Overview**
- Visual: A flowchart or diagram of the automation project.
- Text: "Project Overview"
- Bullet Points:
  - **Goals and objectives:** The primary goal of our project was to automate the entire release process, from triggering builds to RLM ID creation, reducing human intervention and errors.
  - **Scope of automation:** Our project encompassed automating release activities, including Jenkins build triggering, API-based Jenkins build reports, Bitbucket merge checks, RLM ID creation, and RLM reports generation.
  - **Technologies used:** We leveraged cutting-edge technologies, such as Jenkins, Bitbucket APIs, custom scripts, and Excel automation, to achieve our automation goals.

**Slide 6: Key Features**
- Visual: Icons or images representing project features.
- Text: "Key Features"
- Bullet Points:
  - **Automated Jenkins build triggering:** We developed a system where providing the microservice and environment name triggers Jenkins builds automatically, with build result notifications.
  - **API-based Jenkins build reports:** We introduced an API to retrieve the latest Jenkins build reports, making it easy to check build status.
  - **Bitbucket merge checks:** Automation scripts now handle forward and backward merges on Bitbucket, raising pull requests if not completed.
  - **RLM ID automation:** We automated the creation of RLM IDs, eliminating the need for manual creation.
  - **RLM Reports automation:** Automation now retrieves and populates RLM reports data in Excel files, eliminating manual data entry.
  - **Streamlined validation and verification:** We found creative ways to perform validation, significantly reducing verification time.

**Slide 7: Before and After Automation**
- Visual: Two columns showing the old manual process vs. the new automated process.
- Text: "Before and After Automation"
- Bullet Points:
  - **Jenkins Build Trigger:** Significant time saved in triggering builds and monitoring.
  - **Jenkins Build Reports:** Substantial time saved in accessing and reviewing reports.
  - **Bitbucket Merge Checks:** Considerable time saved in code merge validation.
  - **RLM ID Creation:** Significant time saved in RLM ID creation.
  - **RLM Reports:** Substantial time saved in generating RLM reports.
  - **Validation and Verification:** Substantial time saved in validation and verification.
