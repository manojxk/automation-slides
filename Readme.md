Certainly, here's the table with rephrased descriptions to make them more professional and elegant, along with filling in all the columns with the information you provided:

**Slide: Automation Benefits**

| Process                 | Before Automation | One Stop Utility          | After Automation | Time Saving |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Bitbucket Merge Checks** | Manual verification of forward and backward merges on Bitbucket branches, a process that required meticulous attention. | The One Stop Utility currently features a branch comparison function. | Automation scripts perform comprehensive checks and initiate pull requests, ensuring the integrity of code. | Previously, this process consumed 2 hours of valuable time. Now, it can be accomplished in a matter of minutes. |
| **Jenkins Build Trigger** | A labor-intensive, manual process involving the search for component names, access to Bitbucket, and the initiation of Jenkins builds, followed by manual monitoring and notification. | The One Stop Utility provides the option for manual initiation of Jenkins builds and checking. | Our fully automated process requires only the provision of microservice and environment names to trigger Jenkins builds. The system delivers automated build result notifications, enhancing efficiency. | Before automation, this process consumed 6 hours. Now, it can be executed in just 2 minutes. |
| **Jenkins Build Reports** | The manual preparation of Jenkins build reports, necessitating searches for component names and manual entry of build information into Excel spreadsheets. Limited reporting options were available. | Automation streamlines the retrieval of the latest Jenkins build reports, including essential data like build tags and build-triggered times, significantly reducing effort and time requirements. | Previously, this process consumed 6 hours. Now, it can be completed in just 2 minutes. |
| **RLM ID Creation** | The manual creation and promotion of RLM IDs between environments, a process prone to errors and requiring extensive time and effort. The One Stop Utility did not offer an RLM ID creation option. | We've implemented automated RLM ID creation, starting from DIT2->SIT2->UAT1/UAT2->PROD1/JPPROD2. | Previously, this process required 30-35 hours. Now, it can be accomplished in just 2 minutes. |
| **RLM Reports** | Previously, this involved manual searches for component names in RLM and the manual entry of RLM IDs into an Excel sheet. The One Stop Utility did not offer an option for generating RLM reports specific to particular environments. | Automation scripts efficiently retrieve and populate data, including RLM IDs for all environments, status updates, and initiation dates in an Excel file, effectively eliminating manual data entry. | Before automation, this process consumed 10-15 hours. Now, it can be completed in just 2 minutes. |
| **Validation and Verification** | A labor-intensive manual validation process requiring extensive verification time. The One Stop Utility did not offer a verification option. The final sheet is manually prepared by the team and may necessitate review and correction of inaccurate values through manual intervention. | Previously, this process required 10-15 hours of valuable time. Now, it can be accomplished in just 2 minutes. |

This refined table provides a professional and elegant representation of the automation benefits with detailed descriptions and time-saving achievements.
