Thank you for providing the additional information about the RLM reports process. Let's update the table to include this specific process:

**Slide 7: Before and After Automation**

| Process                  | Before Automation                                              | After Automation                                            | Time Saving |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Jenkins Build Trigger** | Manual process involving searching component name, accessing Bitbucket, and triggering Jenkins build, followed by manual monitoring and notification. | Fully automated process: Simply provide microservice and environment names to trigger Jenkins build; receive automated build result notifications. | Significant time saved in triggering builds and monitoring. |
| **Jenkins Build Reports** | Manually retrieve Jenkins build reports by accessing Jenkins dashboard. | Automated retrieval of the latest Jenkins build reports through API calls, reducing the effort and time required. | Substantial time saved in accessing and reviewing reports. |
| **Bitbucket Merge Checks** | Manually check forward and backward merges on Bitbucket branches. | Automated scripts perform checks and raise pull requests if necessary, ensuring code integrity. | Considerable time saved in code merge validation. |
| **RLM ID Creation**       | All RLM IDs created manually, a time-consuming and error-prone process. | Automated generation of RLM IDs during release, eliminating manual efforts and reducing errors. | Significant time saved in RLM ID creation. |
| **RLM Reports**           | Manually search for component names in RLM and enter RLM IDs in an Excel sheet. | Automated script retrieves and populates data in an Excel file from RLM, eliminating manual data entry. | Substantial time saved in generating RLM reports. |
| **Validation and Verification** | Manual validation processes with longer verification times. | Innovative automated methods for validation, significantly reducing verification time. | Substantial time saved in validation and verification. |

The updated table now includes the "RLM Reports" process, indicating how automation has significantly saved time by eliminating manual data entry tasks in generating RLM reports.
